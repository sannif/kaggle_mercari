This repositorty contains my work on the [Mercari kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercari-price-suggestion-challenge).
Mercari is an online platform where people buy and sell differents products, most of the time already used. The aim of the competition
is to predict the value of a product in order to propose a selling price to a seller.

The main challenges of this competition were the size and the nature of the data set. As a matter of fact, 
there are categorical variables with more than 2000 levels. Moreover there is free text that needs to be transformed as features.
I ranked 1237 out of 2384.
